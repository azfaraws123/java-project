# Bomb Detection Simulation

This is a simple Java application that simulates a bomb detection scenario in a military context. The application randomly places a bomb on a grid, and the user attempts to locate it by entering coordinates.

## Features

- Randomly places a bomb on an NxN grid.
- Allows the user to input coordinates to detect the bomb.
- Displays the number of attempts taken to locate the bomb.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bomb-detection-simulation.git
   cd bomb-detection-simulation\
   ```


```
 Enter grid size (NxN): 5
Bomb detection simulation started.
Enter x coordinate to scan: 2
Enter y coordinate to scan: 3
No bomb detected at (2, 3). Try again.
Enter x coordinate to scan: 4
Enter y coordinate to scan: 1
Bomb detected at (4, 1)! Attempts taken: 2
Bomb is placed at coordinates: (4, 1)

```
